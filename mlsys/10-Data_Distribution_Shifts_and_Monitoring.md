# Data Distribution Shifts

## Types of Data Distribution Shifts	14
  ### Covariate Shift	15
Statistics: a covariate is an independent variable that can influence the outcome of a given statistical trial.
Supervised ML: input features are covariates
Input distribution changes, but for a given input, output is the same

### Label Shift	17
Output distribution changes but for a given output, input distribution stays the same.


### Concept Drift	18
Concept drift, also known as posterior shift, is when the input distribution remains the same but the conditional distribution of the output given an input changes. You can think of this as “same input, different output”.
