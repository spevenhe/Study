## Batch prediction is not always cheap and not effcient in performance.

batch 跑批需要针对所有用户，而实时只针对访问的用户

## online prediction

1. A (near) real-time pipeline that can work with incoming data, extract streaming features (if needed), input them into a model, and return a prediction in near real-time. A streaming pipeline with real-time transport and a stream computation engine can help with that.

2. A fast-inference model that can generate predictions at a speed acceptable to its end users. For most consumer apps, this means milliseconds.

## make model run faster

1. do inference faster
2. model smaller
3. hardware which model’s deployed on run faster


# Model Compression
1. Low-rank Factorization
2.
